1.Human SOD2 Protein
Length: The human SOD2 protein has a length of 222 amino acids.
Subcellular Localisation: It is localised in the mitochondria. This is important as mitochondria are major sites of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and SOD2 plays a crucial role in protecting this organelle from oxidative damage by catalysing the dismutation of superoxide radicals.
2.Online BLAST Results
The reported online BLAST results showed a range of percentage identities. The range of percentage identities is 58.1 - 100%. This range gives an indication of the similarity between the human SOD2 protein sequence and other sequences in the database. Higher percentages suggest closer evolutionary relationships or conserved functional domains.
3.Python - based Comparisons
For the three comparisons performed using Python:
Comparison 1: The alignment score was 1097 and the percentage of identical amino acids was 90.09%.
Comparison 2: The alignment score was -254 and the percentage of identical amino acids was 4.50%.
Comparison 3: The alignment score was -258 and the percentage of identical amino acids was 4.95%.
These scores and percentages help in quantifying the similarity between the sequences being compared. Higher alignment scores and percentages of identical amino acids indicate more similar sequences.
4.Closely - related Sequences
Based on the above analysis, the sod2 of human and mouse are the most closely related. This judgment is based on the fact that among these alignment sequences, Comparison 1 has the highest alignment score of 1097 and the highest percentage of the same amino acids of 90.09%.
